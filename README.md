## How to Add a Proposal 

Add proposal to the `groups/proposals` directory and when the PR is approved it is merged into `main` it will be automatically submitted. 


The `groups/example_proposals` directory contains examples.


## Groups 
The members and policies files are not automatically executed and are here for informational/tracking purposes only. They are managed by an offline key.
